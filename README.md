# Comic Strip Scraper
This is a web-scraper I wrote using Python to practice web-scraping using the Beautiful Soup library. This script was written for educational purposes only.

It currently only works for Dilbert comic strips.

I plan on modifying/extending the code at some point to extend it to other comic strips and potentially add a GUI interface using PySide.

Python 3.x is required to be installed.
