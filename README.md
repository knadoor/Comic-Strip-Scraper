# Comic Strip Scraper
This is a 'server friendly' web-scraper I wrote using Python to practice web-scraping using the Beautiful Soup library. It contains code to ensure the server is not bombarded with requests and any comics that fail to download due to a remote server disconnect, it automatically picks up where it left off after a timeout expires.

This script was written for educational purposes only.

It currently only works for Dilbert comic strips. I plan on extending the code at some point to include other comic strips and potentially add a GUI interface using PySide.

Python 3.x is required to be installed.
